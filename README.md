# 2023 300DTD Ordering System Demo

A demo ordering system, showing how a **relational DB** can be linked to a **web UI** using **PHP**

The UI is mobile-friendly. It makes use of [Simple CSS](https://github.com/waimea-cpy/simple-css) to get the UI looking good quickly.

Orders go into a cart implemented using **PHP sessions**, then can be pushed up to the database (provided the user is logged in).

Previous orders can be reviewed.

There is scope for an admin user to be added, with overview of all orders, ability to 'process' orders, etc.
